# Credit-default-risk-prediction-
#This machine learning project predicts the risk of default of a personal credit based on financial and demographic factors. First, it identifies those factors affecting the risk of default through visualisations. Then, it determines if a credit application will most likely be on default in the future or not through Logistic regression. Furthermore, I use K-Means for clustered data, and Decision Tree methods. For testing, the Test-Train-Split evaluation method along Cross Validation are used.
